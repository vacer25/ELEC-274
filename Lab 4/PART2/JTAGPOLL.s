# JTAGPOLL - Code to handle reading and writing JTAG UART in polled mode.
#
# Author:
# David Athersych, P.Eng. Cynosure Computer Technologies Inc.
#
# HISTORY:
# 170114 DFA	First release, based on code found in Altera documentation
#				and on several websites.  Intended for QECE ELEC274.
# 170222 DFA	Added echo to read character routine

# Parameters:
#	none
# Return value:
